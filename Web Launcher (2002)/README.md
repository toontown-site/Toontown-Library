To run this, you will need:

The sv1.0.6.9 client, with a full local server (have not figured out yet how to do custom login)

A Windows XP machine/VM (it won't work on 10)

Internet explorer(XP preinstalled version will work but preferable on IE7)

Some type of server(for the files)

Make sure the 2003 client is in the proper directory (/Program Files/Disney/Disney Online/Toontown/)

Right now I'm using a modified SWF, the movie.swf does work however the percent gets stuck. I am also missing a swf: messages.swf, that would complete the collection, so if you know someone who has it possibly saved, please contact me.
