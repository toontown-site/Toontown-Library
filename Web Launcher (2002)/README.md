To run this, you will need:

The sv1.0.6.9 client, with a full local server (have not figured out yet how to do custom login)

A Windows XP machine/VM (it won't work on 10)

Internet explorer(XP preinstalled version will work but preferable on IE7)

Some type of localhost server(for the files)


Make sure the 2003 client is in the proper directory (/Program Files/Disney/Disney Online/Toontown/)

Right now I'm using a modified SWF, the movie does work however the percent gets stuck. I am also missing a swf: messages.swf, that would complete the collection and make everything work almost exactly like in 2002. 

If you or anyone you know has any good Toontown artifacts from 2002-pre launch, or is willing to help me properly restore this, please contact my Discord at Jeeperpretzel#1190. It would be greatly appreciated
