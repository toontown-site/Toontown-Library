      <b>March 7, 2007 [sv1.0.25.14]</b>
<ul>
<li>The Toon Council is proud to announce our newest addition to Toontown -- please put your paws and hoofs together and join us in welcoming the Pig to our Toon family! Members can now create Pig Toons and bring a little swine to the party!
</ul>
<br>


<b>March 1, 2007 [sv1.0.25.13]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Attention Toons over age 13!</b> Toontown is now integrated with the new <b><u>Disney XD</u></b> on Disney.com!
<br><br>
Here's what we need you to do to take advantage of the new features:
<ul>
<li>Log into <u>play.toontown.com</u> and verify your account name and password. It is possible that you may be prompted to choose a new account name. If so, please go ahead and complete that process. Do not start playing Toontown yet!
<li>Go to <a href="http://disney.go.com/dxd">Disney XD</a> on <a href="http://www.disney.com">Disney.com</a> and log in using your Toontown account name and password and create a D-Name.
<li>Set your chat permissions in DXD to allow True Friends (was Secret Friends) through the "Open Chat With Unlimited True Friends" option under the Communication Preferences Tab in your DXD Account Manager.  <b>*** Please Note ***</b> By default your new DXD account will have the same chat permissions as your Toontown account.
<li>Create and exchange DXD True Friend Codes (was Secret Friends) with people you know who have also created a D-Name. You'll then be able to Chat with your True Friends no matter where either of you are in the Disney.com network, including from within Toontown.
<li>Log into Toontown and chat with your new D-Name friends.
</ul>
For more details about D-Names, DXD, and chat permissions please visit:
<br><br>
<a href="http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faqs#community8">http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faqs#community8</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once you have some True Friends, we want you to check out the new Friends List features.
<ul>
<li>Friends listed in green are SpeedChat friends, and those listed in blue are True Friends (was Secret Friends) who you can chat openly with.  This color scheme better matches the colors of the OpenChat and SpeedChat buttons.
<li>Player Friends will be highlighted in <b>BOLD</b> when they are logged into Toontown.
</ul>
The Friends List also has new tabs:
<ul>
<li>Online Toon Friends - This list only your Toontown friends who are currently online, by Toon name.
<li>All Toon Friends - This lists all of your Toontown friends, by Toon name.
<li>Online Player Friends . This list only your Disney.com account friends who are currently online, by D-Name.
<li>All Player Friends . This lists all of your Disney.com account friends, by D-Name.
<li>Each Friends List tab now sorts alphabetically within each color group.
<li>Toontown True Friends codes will now have a "TT" prefix to better differentiate them from DXD True Friends codes.
</ul>
Please try out the new features and let us know what you think!  Be sure to report any bugs via our <a href="http://play.toontown.com/reportBug.php">Report a Bug page</a>!

</ul>
<hr>

<li>Fixed a bug that would occasionally cause a crash when you water a plant. 
<li>Fixed graphics associated with harvesting gags from a tree planted on a slope. 
</ul>


<b>September 14, 2006 [sv1.0.22.15]</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Estate gardening is here - can you dig it?

<ul>
<li>Spruce up your Toon's estate with new gardening tools available in your next issue of Clarabelle's Cattlelog! Plant jellybeans around your house, add water, and watch 'em sprout. Once they've bloomed, pick 'em and sell 'em at the wheel-barrel to earn more jellybeans for planting! 
<li>The more you garden, the greater the variety of flowers you can plant. Advance your skills to purchase better gardening tools, earn trophies, and add to your total Laff Point level. Master gardeners can enhance their estates with statues and fountains available only from Clarabelle's Cattlelog. 
<li>And if you're running low on cream pies, plant a gag and watch a gag tree grow a stash of'em for you to pick and use in battle. Plant up to eight different trees around your estate. Plus, organically-grown gags have an advantage against the Cogs!
</ul>
</ul>

<b>August 23, 2006 [sv1.0.21.13]</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated Estate Cannon game with minor refinements in collision detection.

<li>Made sure the T-Shirt Contest winners' designs were available to all Toons in the Cattlelog. 
</ul>

<b>August 2, 2006 [sv1.0.21.9]</b>
<ul>
<li>Six Estate cannons will be available for a 48 hour rental period in your next issue of Clarabelle's Cattlelog. Play in pinball mode, where a high score is awarded for careening off the most objects, or in Toon-Up mode, where the more times you hit the floating target (while the clock is ticking!), the more Laff Points are restored.
<li>Winning designs from the T-Shirt Design Contest - 3 US winners and 1 UK winner - are now available for purchase from Clarabelle's Cattlelog.
<li>Fixed an issue with the game sometimes incorrectly assigning DirectX 7 (which is no longer supported) and thus would result in the player unable to start Toontown.
<li>Toons now have shadows while walking on dirt paths in the Estate.
</ul>
