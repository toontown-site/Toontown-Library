<b>May 23, 2006 [sv1.0.20.19]</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Made changes which will make sure Toons receive the reward for defeating the Chief Justice.
<li>Corrected a few typographical errors
<li>Fixed a bug that caused problems with gift purchases and referrals for Toons with international characters in their names.
<li>Improved stability by eliminating the ability to skip certain battles in the DA's office.
<li>Improved game stability when interacting with the Mailbox in your Estate.
</ul>

<b>May 4, 2006 [sv1.0.20.18]</b>
<ul>
<li>We've made some enhancements to the Chief Justice battle.  Here are the details:
<ul>
<li>In the 9 Cogs difficulty case, a Toon's evidence will have a bonus weight of 1 for every juror after the first one is successfully put on the jury. For example, if a Toon were able to put 3 jurors successfully onto the jury, the total weight for her evidence would be 3 (1 + 2 bonus). During the bonus state (when all Cogs are stunned) this would double to 6!
<li>In the most difficulty case (10 Cogs!), the evidence bonus weight will be 1 for ever juror successfully put on the jury.  For example, if a Toon shot 4 jurors into the jury box successfully, the total weight of her evidence would be 5 (1 + 4 bonus).
<li>You can now click on other Toons in the Chief Justice battle to see their health, and the Friends Panel should also appear.
<li>The cannon ammo indicator during jury selection will now blink when you are about to run out of shots.
<li>The Chief Justice will perform his area attack less frequently.
<li>It should now be easier to hit the pan on the scales of justice when it is very low (i.e. when Toons are winning!).
<li>We've added a SpeedChat phrase for telling other Toons your evidence weight bonus during Chief Justice battle. If you have no bonus it will not be available.
</ul>
<li>Made changes to help correct some elevator woes inside the DA's Office Lobby.
<li>The damage of Sellbot HQ's Factory Goons has been decreased.
<li>Fixed the graphics issues with the snow flakes in The Brrrgh.
<li>The names of Toons with the Polar Bear effect should now be legible.
<li>Fixed a typo in Dr. Pullyurleg's dialogue when he offers you a new gag track to pick.
<li>Fixed a few crash causing bugs and improved general stability.
</ul>


<b>April 27, 2006 [sv1.0.20.15]</b>
<ul>
<li>Maintenance release.
</ul>

<b>April 25, 2006 [sv1.0.20.14]</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Court is now in Session - Lawbot HQ is here!</b> Check out Polar Place, the new street in The Brrrgh, which not only leads to Lawbot HQ but is the new home to last month's winning Knock-Knock Joke Contest entries.
<li>The number of Merits earned in Sellbot Factory has been increased by a factor of two. This does not affect the gag experience multiplier.
<li>Update to the Districts Shticker Book page: Districts with a red light indicate that the District is highly populated at this time and that gameplay would be compromised if traffic increased. Districts with a green light indicate this is the best place to be at this very moment.  Districts with a blue light indicate that this is a less populated District, optimal for looking for the building you may need, but fewer Toons to work with.
<li>Fixed a bug that caused a crash when someone finishes a Kart race right when they "Time Out".
<li>Fixed the Whole Cream Pie delivery quest text so directions to Tom will be given by Fifi.
<li>Some dialogue concerning Cog Summons have been changed.
<li>Screenshots will no longer have debug text all over the image.
<li>Fixed a problem in Kart Racing where the race progress GUI sometimes did not appear in a timely manner.
<li>Added new SpeedChat options specific to Lawbot HQ.
</ul>

<b>March 22, 2006 [sv1.0.19.9]</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that occasionally causes Toons to crash out if they are near other Toons getting on and off the race starting pads in Goofy Speedway.
</ul>


<b>March 21, 2006 [sv1.0.19.8]</b>
<ul>
<li>We have added more features to the 3-day Trial account.  Check it out!
<li>Fixed a bug that was causing Doodles to walk away from Toons right after performing a trick.
<li>Fixed a bug that caused some Toons' Estates to sometimes "disappear" and become inaccessible.
<li>Fixed a graphics issue that caused some players to see incorrect colors/textures and other graphics glitches.

e in a Karting Toon Battle.

</ul>

<b>January 19, 2006 [sv1.0.18.38]</b>
<ul>
<li>Some changes have been applied to Karting so it is less likely for a Kart to end up in "grey space" outside of a track, and if it happens the Toon and Kart will be teleported back onto the track.
<li>The "skid/smoke" effect will no longer show up while a Kart is flying in midair while taking a corner.
<li>Fixed a bug that caused Toons who timed out during a Grand Prix race to immediately time out again when they try to enter another Grand Prix race.
<li>Fixed a background graphics issue with Airborne Acres Reverse track where one might have seen a black "tear" in the landscape.
<li>Fixed bug that caused qualify and race win trophies to not be awarded for the new tracks.
</ul>


<b>January 12, 2006 [sv1.0.18.37]</b>
<br>
<br>
Start your engines! Goofy Speedway has expanded and now features three additional racetracks, as well as a Grand Prix tournament!
<ul>
<li>Each track entrance now offers an additional racetrack (and its reverse counterpart): <u>City Circuit</u> now also leads to <u>Blizzard Boulevard</u>, <u>Screwball Stadium</u> will now also lead to <u>Corkscrew Coliseum</u>, and <u>Rustic Raceway</u> will also take you to <u>Airborne Acres</u>.
<li>All signs under each tunnel will flash several times before changing to the different race track name. Once you are on the starting block waiting for the race to start, the racetrack will not change.
<li>The new Grand Prix event will require Toons to Toon Battle through three racetracks in succession! The Toon with the highest score in the entire event wins! It costs more to enter but the rewards are well worth it (not to mention the bragging rights!).
<li>There's a new gag available for Toon Battle. Can you guess what it is? (HINT: it goes "SPLAT!")
</ul>
Here are additional bug fixes:
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue with Bear stinky SpeedChat phrases performing the wrong emote.
<li>Fixed a rare crash caused by the Mailbox buttons being clicked in rapid succession.
<li>Toons will now "timeout" of a Kart race if they take too long to finish. Currently that time is set to 60 seconds above the qualifying time for that track.
<li>Fixed bug that may cause an "invisible" Toon to be present during a Cog battle.
<li>Made several crash fixes.

</ul>

<b>April 13, 2005 [sv1.0.15.26]</b>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the new Merits/Cogbucks reward fix to correct a problem with the merit requirements to advance beyond level 12 Cogs.
<br><br>
A new addition to the Player's Guide will detail this change in the future.
<li>Fixed sign/title mismatch for building "Billy Budd's Big Bargain Binnacle Barn".
<li>Just for fun Toon effects like Big Head or Giant Toon will now be inactive while inside the Mint because they could make some jumping puzzles awkward and difficult.  They will take effect once more when your Toon leaves the Mint.
<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes your Friends Panel would display the incorrect mood for your Doodle when you are not in your Estate.
</ul>

<b>April 05, 2005 [sv1.0.15.25]</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that awarded an excessive amount merits and/or item recoveries in any multi-stage battle (i.e. buildings, factories, mints). Now the number of merits received will be increased by the same multiplier used for the gag skill credit.
<br><br>
  For example, merits recovered on the third floor of a building will be multiplied by a factor of two. The result is that in most cases the number of merits gained after the bug fix is comparable to before the fix. Item recovery rates have not been adjusted.
<br><br>
  Furthermore, the increase of necessary merits for promotion will now be more gradual leading up to level 50 cogs. Once you reach level 50 for a cog type you will no longer need to collect merits to fight that cog type's boss, you will earn an executive washroom key which will let you come and go as you please!
<br><br>
  Please note that Merits/Cogbucks reward will be given only when Toons finish the whole Building/Factory/Mint.
<br><br>
  For more information about how the skill credit multiplier works please refer to the Player's Guide.
<li>Fish Bingo Wednesdays will now last all day, from 12:00AM PT to 11:59PM PT.
<li>Reduced Train noise volume by half in the Train Yard.
<li>Fixed a typo for building sign "Wet Suit Dry Cleaners".
<li>Fixed incorrect "Mary's Go Around Travel Agency" sign again, now it should read "Mary's Go Around Travel Company".

Attention all Toons! <b>Pet Shops</b> and <b>Doodles</b> are finally here!
<br><br>
Each Playground has its own Pet Shop, which looks like a fire hydrant.
<br><br>
In the Pet Shop you can adopt or return a Doodle, as well as sell fish. There are boy and girl Doodles in a variety of shapes and colors to choose from.
<br><br>
Each Doodle has a unique personality, and their moods are influenced by your interaction with them. Once adopted, you can pick a name for your Doodle from a list of thousands, and they will appear at your estate ready for play!
<br><br>
You can feed your Doodles, pet them, and teach them to perform tricks. Doodles will heal your toon when they successfully perform a trick. Be sure to look for new tricks to purchase from the Cattlelog so you can have more fun with your Doodle.
<br><br>
If you want a happy Doodle, be sure to give it lots of attention! They'll even understand your calls and SpeedChat phrases!
<br><br>
Some details about adopting Doodles:
<ul>
<li>Doodles with more desirable traits and "looks" will be available in Pet Shops in different Playgrounds. The more desirable the Doodle, the higher the adoption price.
<li>Pet Shops have a rotating stock of Doodles. They stock three types in each gender at a time. Each type will stay in the Pet Shop for three days and then be replaced by a new type. Your Doodle loves Jellybeans!  Each time you feed them it will cost your Toon 1 Jellybean.

It has been very exciting for us to develop this new area of Toontown, and hopefully it is as fun for you to play in.  Cog HQ introduces new physics, environments, enemies, story elements, and game play.

<p><b>A Brief CogHQ Overview</b></p>

<p>Toons have been taken hostage by the Cogs! They are being held on the top floor of CogHQ. It is your mission to gang up and rescue them. Getting into CogHQ will not be easy though; their tight security will detect and reject any Toons that enter. You must build a Cog disguise first by recovering Cog parts from their factory. The factory is a 4-player environment with many new game-play elements. You can keep track of your Cog disguise progress with a new page in your Shticker Book.

<p>Once you have your entire Cog disguise built you can enter the Cog HQ lobby dressed as a Cog. The Sellbot Boss is a very busy Cog, so the guard will not allow you to see the Boss unless you have important Cog business, such as needing a promotion. You must earn your promotion by fighting Sellbots to collect "merits" around Toontown. Merits are given out after every battle just like Gag experience and are recorded in your Shticker Book as well. The elevator to the top of Cog HQ holds 8 players so when you are ready for your promotion, group up with your friends and head up to battle the Boss.

<p>If you defeat the Sellbot Boss Cog you will free the hostage Toon who will in turn present you with his "trading card". You can use these cards in battle to call on them for extra assistance in a tough spot. Of course, knowing the Cogs they will quickly build another Sellbot Boss Cog, so hurry and get your next promotion to rescue another Toon. There are 40 total promotions as you work your way up the corporate ladder.

<b>December 3, 2003 [sv1.0.8.12]</b>
<ul>
<li>Rolled back to original MIDI files to fix grey-screen freeze on some Windows 98 computers.
<li>Fixed Name-Your-Toon crash when submitting a name for approval on high-latency connections.
<li>Fixed crash when fishing at an estate when the owner leaves.

<li>New ActiveX control.
</ul>

<p>If you are away from Toontown for several weeks, your next Cattlelog will not skip ahead to catch up when you come back and login again. Instead, you will receive the next Cattlelog in line so you do not miss anything.  For example, if you have received Issue #2, then the next issue you will get after not logging in for a few weeks will be Issue 3.

<ul>
<li>Game crash while you were in the tutorial and the game was still downloading is fixed now.

</ul>
</p>

<b>November 14, 2003 [sv1.0.8.6]</b>
<p><b>Fishing</b>
<br>New fishing system and interface integrated. Here are the basics:
<ul>
<li>You can now catch fish in the ponds located in every playground and street in Toontown. As you fish at a pond, your new fishing bucket will fill up with the fish you catch. When your bucket is full, or if you run out of Jellybeans, you need to sell the fish to the Pet Shop Clerks located near the ponds in the Playgrounds.

<li>Fish that are heavier and more rare are worth more Jellybeans. There are 50 total fish species. Some fish have particular ponds where they live, others can be found in every pond.

<li>Your fishing rod can be upgraded by purchasing stronger rods sold in Clarabelle's Cattlelog.  Better rods are stronger and can catch heavier fish, but cost more Jellybeans to fish with.  Everytoon intially has the "twig" fishing rod.

<li>Each 10 fish species you collect will earn you a fishing trophy and +1 Laff Boost, bringing the maximum Laff points up to 105. You can keep track of the fish you have seen and the trophies you have with a new page in your Shticker Book.

renamed now have a "2" at the end, such as "Flippy2". All passwords remained the same.

<b>September 16, 2002 [sv1.0.29]</b></br></br>
We fixed the 35HP limit ToonTask bug and extra gag track choosing ToonTasks. To
do so, we had to revoke some track access and HP that was given out
prematurely. You may find you no longer have access to some gag
tracks given as a result of this bug. <b>Rest assured, your Toon will keep all experience
gained while using that track.</b> You will see this experience reappear when
your Toon has retrained those tracks. A few Toons also lost some ToonTask
progress and will need to pick between Drop and Lure again. We apologize
for this error.
</p>

Your bug reports have been a great help to the development of
Toontown. Thank you for your continued support as we strive to make
Toontown the best game it can be. We expect to send out more
accounts to fan club members once this latest release is stable.

What's New In Version 1.0.7
<p/>

<a name="login"><b>IMPORTANT: Login</b></a>

<p/>

There is a new login procedure. Instead of logging in on the web page,
just click the red "PLAY" button. You will be prompted for a user name
and password once you are in the game. Your old user name (i.e.
toonbeta555) and password will no longer work. Simply create a new
account to play. Feel free to tell your friends and family to create
accounts and play Toontown with you. Toontown is still free of charge
during this beta period.

<p/>

Your old Toons will no longer be in the game. We have started a new
Toon database to support this easier login procedure and to make some
final improvements to the Toontask system. Send email to
<a href="mailto:toontown@disneyonline.com">toontown@disneyonline.com</a> with
your old user name (i.e. toonbeta555) and the name of a newly created
empty account to put your old toons in if you would like to restore
your old Toons stats.

<p/>

<b>Trolley Games</b>
<ul>
<li>Match Minnie has been completed with new artwork, sound effects, and animations. </li><p>

<li>The Tag game has new tag animation and sound effects. </li><p>

<li>The swim game has an easier to use camera mode. </li><p/>

<li>The race game has working chance cards.</li><p/>
</ul>
<p/>
<b>Neighborhoods</b>
<ul>
<li>Mickey's old pal Pluto is hanging out in The Brrrgh neighborhood.</li><p/>

<li>Interactive elements have been added to Minnie's and Daisy's playgrounds. </li><p/>

<li>All streets have names which you will see on the tunnel signs. </li><p/>

<li>Your map shows the street or playground you are currently in. </li><p/>

<li>Many Toon buildings have new names. </li><p/>

<li>Stop by any Toon side door (not the main double doors) for a knock knock joke. </li><p/>

<li>The Toons have moved into their buildings with new furniture and decor. </li><p/>

<li>Many collision surfaces have been fixed so you should get stuck less and pop through fences less.</li><p/>
</ul>

<p/>
<b>Cog Buildings</b>
<ul>
<li>Cog building interiors are now more in tune with the difficulty of the surrounding neighborhood.</li><p/>

<li>You will see fewer cog buildings and a more balanced Cog behavior. </li><p/>

<li>You can tell how many floors are inside Cog buildings and what floor you are on once inside with the new elevator lights just above the doors. </li><p/>

<li>Cog buildings now show the name of the Toon building taken over. </li><p/>

<li>When you defeat a Cog building, your experience gained on each floor is multiplied by the floor level, so as you work your way up you really rack up the experience! </li><p/>

<li>Cogs walk in and out of cog building side doors now and open toon building front doors too.</li><p/>

<li>Many high level Cog attacks have been added. </li><p/>

<li>New sound effects have been inserted into many Cog attacks.</li><p/>
</ul>

<p/>
<b>User Interface</b>
<ul>
<li>Mouse pointer problems have been fixed.</li><p/>

<li>New controls on the Options Page in the Shticker Book allow you to change the screen resolution and turn music and sound effects on and off. </li><p/>

<li>The reward panel after winning battles now shows gag experience progress more clearly and updates your Toontask progress when you defeat Cogs relevant to your tasks.</li><p/>
</ul>
<p/>
<b>Gag Experience</b>
<ul>
<li>Your high level gags will no longer give you experience against low level Cogs. The gag detail window will show you when you will not get credit for using a gag in battle. Those gags which will not give you credit will also be a lighter color in your attack panel. You can still use them to defeat the Cogs, but you will not get experience towards the next gag. </li><p/>

<li>Experience gained inside Cog buildings has gone up. Your experience gained on each floor is multiplied by the floor level.</li><p/>
</ul>
<p/>
<b>Whisper Messages</b>
<ul>
<li>Use chat or use the Toontalker to whisper to other Toons without anybody else hearing. You can whisper to anybody on your friends list or any Toon around you by clicking on them and selecting "Whisper" from the Toon detail panel. </li><p/>

<li>You will hear automatic whisper messages whenever a Toon on your friends list enters or leaves Toontown Online.</li><p/>
</ul>
<p/>

<li>Creating new accounts is easier and quicker now. Just click the "Create Account" button on the title screen of the game to make a new Toontown account. </li><p/>

<li>Feel free to tell your friends and family to download and create their own account to play too!</li><p/>
</ul>
<p/>
<b>ToonTasks</b>
<ul>
<li>Toons will no longer ask you to visit a Toon building that has been taken over by Cogs. </li><p/>

<li>To make it easier to find other Toons for your tasks, their building names and street names will appear in the ToonTask description in the Shticker Book. </li><p/>

<li>Teleport rewards have been added to the ToonTasks to give access to teleport to the different playgrounds. </li><p/>

<li>There are now tasks to defeat Cog buildings.</li><p/>
</ul>

<b>October 15, 2001</b>
<br/>
What's New In Version 1.0.7
<p/>

Update fixed many known issues and added new
features.  Please see below for details.
<p/>

<b>Graphic Problems</b>
<p/>
If you see a problem with the graphics inside
Toontown Online, in addition to attaching the
log files please do the following BEFORE YOU EXIT:
<OL>
<LI>PRESS the F9 KEY to automatically save a screenshot image in a file named "[frame_number].bmp" which will be saved in "C:\Program Files\Disney\Disney Online\Toontown"</li>
<li>Exit Toontown Online, go to the START MENU, select RUN, and type DXDIAG.EXE</li>
<li>Click SAVE ALL INFORMATION, which saves the file DxDiag.txt, then exit DXDIAG.EXE</li>
<li>Attach the files "DxDiag.txt" and "[frame_number].bmp" to the bug report, along with a description of the problem, and e-mail to toontown@disneyonline.com</li></OL>
<p/>
<b>Under Contruction Areas</b>
<p/>
Signs for neighborhoods that aren't yet available are marked "under construction."
<p/>
<p><b>New Issues</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Existing Toons may not have all the gags they had prior to this update.  You may also have more gags than are allowed for your Toon (for example, 30/20 gags).  To clear this, die in battle to reset your gag count.  You will then need to complete "ToonTasks" to open these tracks up again.</li>
<p/>
<li>The ability to teleport to other Playgrounds from the map now needs to be earned as a reward, but you can always teleport back to the last Playground you visited, or to any friend.</li>
<p></p>
<li>We have not deleted any existing Toon characters, but we recommend you create a new character on your account to properly test the new ToonTasks.</li>
<p></p>
<li>This update's patches are relatively large because so much new content is included. Future bug-fix type patches should be much smaller in size.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Some ToonTasks require you to defeat certain types of Cogs, such as Money, Corporate, Sales, or Legal -- see What's New for more on this. It is not obvious in the current release which Cogs are which. This will be addressed in a future update.  To help you, Money Cogs have green dollar signs on their outfits, Sales Cogs wear dark plaid, Corporate Cogs wear blue suits, and the Legal Cogs wear brown suits.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Some ToonTasks require you to visit a certain Toon in Toontown. A future release will inform you exactly which building that Toon lives in.  For now, look for word clues, such as finding "Henrietta Hog" in "The Hog Wash."</li>
<p></p>
<li>Although the free chat box is always available, only your "secret friends" will be able to understand what you type -- see What's New for more on this. If you see other Toons barking or meowing, it is because you are not secret friends with them. Use the ToonTalker to tell them to use the ToonTalker.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Another upcoming release should include Trolley Game improvements, new interface artwork, whisper messages, more Cog interiors, new Toon interiors with props, ToonTask improvements, and other enhancements. Please send e-mail to toontown@disneyonline.com with your suggestions and feature requests.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<hr/>
<p><b>What's New in Toontown Online version 1.0.6</b></p>
<p></p>
<b>ToonTasks</b>
<p>You can now enter the buildings in the Playgrounds (such as in Toontown Central) to meet new Toons who will give you "ToonTasks"
to fight Cogs, win back buildings, and deliver gags to other
Toons. You get a reward for each ToonTask finished. Each reward will
increase your Laff Meter, allowing you to carry more gags and giving you access to new types of gags, or advancing your Toon in some other
way. You can check the progress of your ToonTasks with a new page in
your Shticker Book.</p>
<p></p>
<b>ToonTalker</b>
<p>More phrases have been added, and the interface has been made easier to use.  Please e-mail toontown@disneyonline.com with any suggestions for other phrases that you might like.</p>
<p></p>
<b>Secret Friends</b>
<p>In order to provide a safe place for kids to play online, the
ToonTalker is still the basic form of communication, but now you can
also make "secret friends" to chat freely with. To make a secret
friend, you must get a secret code from the Friends List.  You may
then tell someone you know that code (for example, you can tell your
friend at school, or you can tell your family members).  When the
other player types in your code, you will then be able to freely chat,
and no one else will be able to see what you are saying. Each secret
code can be used one time, and expires after 48 hours if unused.</p>
<p></p>
<b>Cog Buildings</b>
<p>You can now venture into Cog office buildings and rescue them from Cog domination, thereby saving Toontown! Up to four Toons can hop in a Cog elevator and battle through several floors and to the top. A Cog boss lurks at the top office of every building. Be careful, battles inside buildings are much tougher than out on the street, so stock up on gags, and find some friends to join you!</p>
<p/>
<b>New Trolley Game</b>
<p>A new Trolley Game has been added -- the Ring Game. Swim through all the rings that are your color. If everybody swims through their rings successfully, your group gets bonus jelly beans.</p>
<p></p>
<b>New Cogs and New Cog Attacks</b>
<p>High-level Cogs have been added to increase difficulty in the tougher neighborhoods and inside Cog buildings.  Cogs also now have more attacks.</p>
<p></p>
<b>Population Count</b>
<p>The Shticker Book now shows the "population" for each Toontown District, so that you can see how many people are playing in your District.</p>
<b>Playground Treasure</b>
<p>Treasure chests have been replaced with themed treasures for each Playground.</p>
<b>New Animation</b>
<p>More animation has been added for Toon battles and for Cog and Toon building takeover sequences.</p>
<p><b>Other Changes include:</b> One new street, more signs, and many graphical fixes; Progress Meter improvements for download indicators; more Disney characters in the Playgrounds; ability to see other players' usernames; various performance and memory optimizations.</p>
