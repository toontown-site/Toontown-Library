				Toontown is the multi player online game that lets you live the life of a Toon. Create your own Toon character, furnish your estate, play games with friends, and explore amazing lands. The best part is it's always growing, always changing, and as wild as your imagination!
				<br><br>
				Did we mention the Cogs? These evil robot business types have invaded, and it's up to you and your friends to join forces to save Toontown! Cogs can't take a joke, so use your giant arsenal of gags to crack them up. Get out your seltzer bottles, drop a few safes, and let the cream pies fly!

				Now that you've created your own Toon and completed the Toontorial, you're ready to earn some jellybeans. Start by getting on the Trolley in Toontown Central and playing some games to earn jellybeans -- the only currency accepted in Toontown.  Go to Goofy's Gag Shop and use your jellybeans to buy gags that you will need to defeat those humorless Cogs. Once you have a gag-filled arsenal, you are ready to head over to Punchline Place, Loopy Lane, or Silly Street to battle the Cogs in the streets. They won't be hard to find - they're everywhere!
				<br><br>
				When you're ready for a real challenge, team up with a few other Toons and head for a Cog building.  On the highest floors you'll encounter Loan Sharks, Minglers, and other truly tedious Cogs - tough robots to get a good laugh out of.

				Your Laff meter will slowly re-fill when you’re hanging around any playground, fishing, or playing Trolley games.  You can also recuperate at your Toon’s estate.  Visit your Toon’s house by clicking the "GO HOME"  button on the map page of the Shticker Book. Order items from Clarabelle’s Cattlelog, redecorate, or run around outside collecting ice cream cones while your Laff meter refills.
				<br><br>
				Toon-up Gags can be used in a battle to fill up other Toons’ Laff meters.  There’s only one hitch: You can’t use a Toon-up Gag on yourself.
				<br><br>
				Your Laff meter will be refilled each time you turn in a completed ToonTask to an HQ Officer.
				<br><br>
				Here’s a tip on Toon etiquette: If you’ve just finished a ToonTask and are heading back to Toon HQ to get your reward, don’t pick up any special items in the playground!  Leave those ice cream cones and other goodies for Toons who need a good Laff.

				Use the jellybeans you've earned playing Trolley games to buy gags at one of Goofy's Gag Shop locations in any of Toontown's playgrounds.
				<br><br>
				Some ToonTasks allow you to carry more jellybeans. These are important tasks because the more jellybeans you carry the more often you'll be able to go to the gag shop and restock quickly. Similarly, some ToonTasks allow you to carry more gags.  The more gags you carry the less often you'll need to go to the gag shop and restock before heading back into battle.

            Is your Toon in need of a serious Toon-up? Then head over to your Estate for cannon games! Play in Pinball mode, where a high score is awarded for bouncing off the most objects, or in Toon-up mode, where Laff Points are restored every time your Toon hits a floating red target.

            To use cannons at your Estate, you'll need to rent them from the latest edition of Clarabelle's Cattlelog. Each rental consists of six cannons appearing on your Estate for a period of 48 hours. The 48-hour period starts from the time you collect the cannons from your mailbox.

            When your Toon is ready to use a cannon, simply run up to it to be loaded in automatically. Use the onscreen controls with your mouse or arrow keys on your keyboard to aim the cannon. To shoot your Toon, press the red FIRE button with your mouse or hit CTRL.

          <b>Pinball Mode</b><br>
          In Pinball mode, objects like house roofs, clouds, the bridge, and the fence all act as Bumpers. Once hit, your Toon will bounce off them and continue to fly through the air. Points, awarded just for fun, are given for every object your Toon hits. Different objects add different points to your score, which is also multiplied by the total number of objects hit. The most recent score and current high score are displayed on a panel at the top of the screen.

Aim your Toon at the floating red target using the arrows onscreen, then FIRE to launch your Toon into the air! The more times your Toon hits the target, the more Laff Points will get restored when the timer runs out. You’re also awarded additional seconds on the timer. Any Toon visiting your Estate can contribute, so the more Toons playing, the quicker the Toon-up!

Plant different jellybean color combinations to grow flowers in designated areas outside your Estate, then water and watch them grow! It will take a day for a flower to fully bloom.  Once it has, pick and sell it for jellybeans at the wheelbarrow located on your Estate.<br><br>  

          The more you garden, the greater the variety of flowers you can plant. There are a total of forty flower species -- including a variety of daisies, tulips, carnations, lilies, pansies, petunias, roses, and daffodils. For every ten flower species that you successfully grow, pick and sell, you will earn one gardening trophy and a +1 boost to your overall Laff Point level.  You can earn a total possible boost of +4 from gardening.<br><br>

          When you pick flowers or water items in your garden, you earn skill points towards new gardening tools. Each Toon starts out by purchasing a Gardening Kit from Clarabelle&#39;s Cattlelog.  This Kit contains a Tin Shovel and Small Watering Can. As you gain more skill, you&#39;ll be able to plant more jellybeans, use more water, and purchase higher level tools.  With your new tools, you&#39;ll be able plant still more jellybeans at one time, unlocking flower breeds and statues.<br><br>

        Once you&#39;ve attained a higher skill level, you no longer earn points by picking a lower level flower.  In other words, once you’ve earned the ability to plant 2 jellybeans, you no longer get skill points for picking flowers grown from 1 jellybean.  However, you may still need to plant flowers using only 1 jellybean to achieve your Laff Point boost.<br><br>

          Running low on cream pies? Plant up to eight gag trees in designated areas around your Toon&#39;s Estate and harvest them to replenish your gag supply.  You can pick gags from trees once a day!
          <br><br>

          Trees must be planted in order of the gag level on each gag track.  In other words, you&#39;ll need to plant a Squirting Flower tree (Gag Level 1) before you can plant a Glass of Water tree (Gag Level 2).  Trees take longer to grow than flowers, and each higher level gag tree takes longer to grow than the previous one.<br><br>

          Once a tree is fully grown, you&#39;ll be able to pick gags from it.  You also receive a damage boost in battle every time you use that specific gag, whether you picked it from the tree or bought it from the Gag Shop.  Make sure you keep the tree healthy.  You’ll lose the damage boost if the tree needs water.<br><br>  

          Also, if you decide to dig up your lower level Squirting Flower tree, you&#39;ll lose the Squirt damage boost and the ability to harvest your higher level Glass of Water tree.<br><br>

          Each statue comes with a specific recipe of jellybeans.  You&#39;ll need to plant the statue with that assortment of jellybeans at the same time.  Statues may only be placed on designated areas around your Estate.<br><br>

                card before the clock runs out to win jellybeans. There are four different Bingo cards: Classic,
                Diagonals, Three Way, or Four Corners. Every hour on the hour, there is a special Super Blockout
                card. The Super Blockout card is played not only against the clock, but against all of the other
                ponds in that district. Each Super Blockout starts with a 1000 jellybean jackpot. Every Super
                Blockout that ends without a winner will increase the jackpot by 100 jellybeans (up to 10,000
                jellybeans).

                Thousands of Doodles have migrated to Toontown and are in search of a good home! Pet Shops in each playground sell a variety of Doodles, with new Doodles available every day. Each Doodle has a different personality - some are hungrier, some sleepier, some more playful and energetic. Doodles come in a variety of colors and patterns: some have spots, some are fuzzier, and some have scales!

                Start saving those jellybeans, because the least expensive Doodles can be adopted in the Toontown Central playground for 200-300 beans. The highest-priced Doodles can cost up to 5000 jellybeans in the Donald’s Dreamland Pet Shop. Choose your Doodle carefully because even though you can return them, you will not get back your jellybeans!

				On the hazy shores east of Toontown Central lies the seaside neighborhood of Donald’s Dock.  If you have a chance, take a swim in the playground and search for starfish.  They can be scarce, but rumor has it they’ll help fill your Laff meter if you can find them. Donald will be happy to give you a ride on his boat - but be warned he’s sticking close to the playground, keeping a weather eye out for Cogs!

Look for blue music notes resting at the feet of the towering horn tunnels, and make sure to take a dip in the pond at the center of the piano key terrace.  Minnie is always around, working to keep her instruments in tip-top shape.

Unfortunately, this is also where you’ll encounter some of the biggest, nastiest, most dangerous Cogs.

					Goons can cause a Toon a lot of problems - one hit from their eye beam will take 5 to 20 Laff points! To disable a Goon temporarily, jump on his head.
				<br><br><br><br>
					From the hallway you have three choices: straight ahead is the warehouse lookout, to the left is the boiler room, and to the right is the gear room. Take either the right or left path to get to the warehouse - there are three Cogs waiting in each location.

 					Toon Tip:

					Check the barrels scattered through the factory for gags. Touch them to replenish your supply!

					Try moving around crates and jumping on them to get at hard to reach places.<br><br>

					When you arrive at the warehouse you’ll need to sneak past the Goons and make your way up to the roof of the storeroom. Defeat the four Cogs here to get access to the switch that opens the door on the far side of the warehouse and use the other switches to activate the stompers. The stompers will get rid of the Goons on the main warehouse floor and clear the way for you.

				Head through the door on the far side of the warehouse and use either elevator to go to the top of the silos. You’ll need to defeat the Cogs on the east and west silos to open the doors. The switches inside these silos open the doors to the center silo, where you’ll face four Cogs in a final battle - including the Factory Foreman. Defeating the Factory Foreman earns your Toon one piece of the Cog Disguise and gets you one step closer to entering Sellbot Towers!

					When the V.P.'s forces have been defeated, the remaining Toons will team up to fight the V.P. himself. Jump up to touch the bottom of the cage where the shopkeeper is being held -- this will stock you with a supply of cream pies you can throw at the V.P. To throw a pie, click on the pie icon at the top of your screen. If you are a PC user, you can also throw a pie by pressing INSERT on your keyboard. If you are a Mac user, you can also throw a pie by pressing FORWARD DELETE on your keyboard. While you hold the button down, you will see a power meter move left and right.  <br><br>
 				<br>
 				<font color="#FF9900">
 					Toon Tip:
 				</font>
					If you release the button when the power meter is all the way to the right, your pie will travel in a very high arc and land near you; if you release when the meter is all the way to the left, your pie will travel in nearly a straight line and land far away. Practice holding and releasing the button at the right time to make the pie land just where you want it!
 				<br><br><br>
 					The V.P. will be doing his best to fight off the Toons around him. Keep moving around to avoid his attacks! Be sure that you jump as soon as you see or hear the V.P. jump, because any Toons standing on the ground when the V.P. lands will fall down and lose 10 Laff points.
				<br><br>
					Your goal is to drive the V.P all the way down the ramp and off the edge of the Cogs' launch pad.  To do this, pelt him with pies in the face or on the chest. The V.P. is one super - tough Cog and most of the time pies don't affect him at all!  In order to knock him back successfully, you'll have to wait until a Toon successfully tosses a pie into his undercarriage while the door is open. This will clog up his works and make the V.P. dizzy for a few seconds. While he's dizzy, pelt him with as many pies in the face and chest as you possibly can before he recovers himself and starts attacking Toons again!
				<br><br>
					If you're one of the Toons trying to gum up his undercarriage, watch carefully for the door in either the front or the back to swing open and try to throw a pie directly in. You can do this either from in front of the V.P. or behind him.
				<br><br><br>
				<font color="#FF9900">
 					For Advanced Toons Only:
 				</font>
 					A well-organized team of Toons should have at least one Toon on each side.  Be careful and don't stand too close when the door opens - streams of gears will fly out!
 				<br><br>
 				<font color="#FF9900">
				 	Toon Tip:
				 </font>
					If you see a fellow Toon whose Laff points are dangerously low, you can throw pies at that Toon to fill his or her Laff points back up. Keep watching out for the V.P.'s jump attack while you do this and be sure someone else is still keeping the V.P. on the defensive. Otherwise he'll start to roll right back up the ramp!

            Toons always have the ability to teleport to a friend in Toontown. However, if a District is close to a full population of Toons, then access via the Shticker Book "Districts" page will be disabled. This helps to prevent a single District from becoming overcrowded.

            When your group of Toons enters the Vault elevator, you will find yourself face to face with the C.F.O. Your group must fight its way through an epic battle of Cogs released by the C.F.O. Use all of your best strategy to keep yourself and your friends happy.

            Battling the C.F.O. requires lots of teamwork. Some Toons will need to operate the cranes while others must jump on and disable the Goons as they emerge from the C.F.O.'s doors. Becoming a first-class crane operator will require practice and skill - a back-and-forth motion with the arrow keys is vital to build sufficient momentum to swing the magnet and toss a disabled Goon at the C.F.O.'s head. Press and hold the CTRL to pick up and hold a Goon or safe - release the CTRL to let go. To leave a crane, press the ESC or click on the RED X in the lower-right corner of the screen.

		    Wait until the C.F.O. is dizzy before throwing a safe or he will use it as a helmet! Hitting the helmet with another safe is the only way to knock it off.

            The C.F.O. doesn't like this Goon-tossing one bit and will throw gears at Toons. These gears result in Laff-loss and will knock a Toon from a crane controller. A Toon-up treasure is produced every time a Goon is disabled so remember to Toon yourself up before you get sad.

            Toons who successfully defeat the C.F.O. are awarded a special phrase that appears on a new SpeedChat->Unite menu. You might win any one of three different kinds of phrases -- when you say the phrase later, it will restock nearby Toons with Laff points, jellybeans, or gags, depending on the phrase. Choose the time to say your new phrase wisely, because each phrase can only be used once.

To earn a promotion and get your day in court with the Lawbot Chief Justice, Toons must defeat Lawbots to acquire Jury Notices.

            Once you have completed your Lawbot suit and have earned enough Jury Notices for a promotion, you are ready to team up with seven other disguised “Public Defender” Toons to combat the Chief Justice on his turf - in the courtroom.

            Battle waves of Lawbots as the Chief Justice taunts you with legalese before heading into jury selection. These Cogs play dirty and have Lawbots on call ready to fly in and sit on a jury at any time. Luckily, Toons come equipped with cannons and Shopkeeper Toons ready to fill the jury box – as long as they are shot into one of the empty seats. The more Shopkeeper Toons impanelled, the further the trial will be tipped in the Toons’ favor, which makes for an easier battle with the Chief Justice.
            <br><br>
            
            The Chief Justice trial is all about the Scales of Injustice - Toons must tip the scales in one direction while the Cogs try to tip it in the other. Toons obtain evidence from witnesses on the stand while Cogs seem to manufacture an unending supply of their own evidence. Cogs can stun Toons, and Toons can stun the Cogs, by flinging evidence at them. Win and the Chief Justice will sheepishly return to his chambers. Lose and suffer the sadness!
