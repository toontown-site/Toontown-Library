					When the V.P.’s forces have been defeated, the remaining Toons will team up to fight the V.P. himself. Jump up to touch the bottom of the cage where the shopkeeper is being held; this will stock you with a supply of cream pies you can throw at the V.P. Press the "Insert" key on your keyboard to throw a pie or click on the pie icon at the top of your screen. While you hold the button down you will see a power meter move left and right.  <br><br>

 					Toon Tip:
 				</font>
					If you release the button when the power meter is all the way to the right, your pie will travel in a very high arc and land near you; if you release when the meter is all the way to the left, your pie will travel in nearly a straight line and land far away. Practice holding and releasing the button at the right time to make the pie land just where you want it!
 				<br><br><br>
 					The V.P. will be doing his best to fight off the Toons around him. Keep moving around to avoid his attacks! Be sure that you jump as soon as you see or hear the V.P. jump, because any Toons standing on the ground when the V.P. lands will fall down and lose 10 Laff points.
				<br><br>
					Your goal is to drive the V.P all the way down the ramp and off the edge of the Cogs' launch pad.  To do this, pelt him with pies in the face or on the chest. The V.P. is one super - tough Cog and most of the time pies don't affect him at all!  In order to knock him back successfully, you’ll have to wait until a Toon successfully tosses a pie into his undercarriage while the door is open. This will gum up his works and make the V.P. dizzy for a few seconds. While he's dizzy, pelt him with as many pies in the face and chest as you possibly can before he recovers himself and starts attacking Toons again!
				<br><br>
					If you're one of the Toons trying to gum up his undercarriage, watch carefully for the door in either the front or the back to swing open and try to throw a pie directly in. You can do this either from in front of the V.P. or behind him.
				<br><br><br>
				<font color="#FF9900">
 					For Advanced Toons Only:
 				</font>
 					A well-organized team of Toons should have at least one Toon on each side.  Be careful and don't stand too close when the door opens - streams of gears will fly out!
 				<br><br>
 				<font color="#FF9900">
				 	Toon Tip:
				 </font>
					If you see a fellow Toon whose Laff points are dangerously low, you can throw pies at that Toon to fill his or her Laff points back up. Keep watching out for the V.P.'s jump attack while you do this and be sure someone else is still keeping the V.P. on the defensive. Otherwise he'll start to roll right back up the ramp!
