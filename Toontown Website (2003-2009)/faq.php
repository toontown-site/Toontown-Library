<p><h4>General Answers</h4></p>

<p><a name="whatis"></a><i><b>What is Disney's Toontown Online?</b></i>
<p>Disney's Toontown Online is the first massively multiplayer online PC game for ages seven and older.  We are giving a special sneak preview to a limited amount of members before we officially release the product.</p>

<p><a name="release"></a><i><b>When will Disney's Toontown Online be available for everyone?</b></i></p>
<p>A release date has not been set, but Charter Members will be the first to know.</p>

<p><a name="rpg"></a><i><b>What is an online multiplayer RPG?</b></i></p>
<p>In role-playing games (RPGs), you create a character and then step into a game world with that character.  Taking an RPG online allows you to play with others -- that's why it's called multiplayer!</p>

<p><a name="todo"></a><i><b>What am I supposed to do in Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>Players create their own cartoon characters and enter Toontown to:</p>
<ul><li>Meet friends and make new friends</li>
<li>Compete in games</li>
<li>Battle the evil robot Cogs</li></ul></p>

<p><a name="cost"></a><i><b>How much does it cost to play Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>When you sign up, you will have a free trial period in which you can experience Toontown at no cost to you. After your free trial period, if you choose to subscribe, a $9.95 Membership fee will be billed on your credit card and a monthly fee of $5.95 will be billed thereafter. This is a SPECIAL price for Charter Members only.</p>

<p><a name="age"></a><i><b>What is the appropriate age for Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>Toontown is for kids ages seven and up.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#genquest">Back to General Questions</a></p>

<p><h4>Technical Answers</p></h4>

<p><a name="computer"></a><i><b>What kind of computer is needed to play Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>You must have a PC -- Toontown does not run on Macintosh computers or on Netscape browsers.  You also need:
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows 98, ME, 2000, or XP</li>
<li>233 MHz or faster CPU</li>
<li>128MB RAM memory (256MB Recommended)</li>
<li>100MB free space on your "\Program Files" hard drive (most likely C:)</li>
<li>A video card with 3-D acceleration, at least 8MB (32MB/AGP card is recommended)</li>
<li>A 56K modem, or a faster Internet connection</li>
<li>Microsoft DirectX 7.0 (or newer)</li>
<li>Microsoft IE v. 4.0 (or newer)</li></ul></p>

<p><a name="hardware"></a><i><b>Do I need any special equipment, such as a 3-D card, to play Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>Yes, you need a 3D video card, but don't worry about checking your
computer.  The Toontown installer will confirm that all necessary
hardware and software is in place prior to installation.
</p>
The following 3D video cards have been tested by our QA staff, and
appear to work with Disney's Toontown Online.  Other cards may work, of course.
This is not an endorsement for any of these products.<br>

Other ATI Rage Pro chipset-based cards<br>
(Rage Pros lack some transparency support)<BR>

<blockquote>
Any card with < 4MB of video memory.<br>
Number Nine Imagine Series 2<br>
3Dfx Voodoo 1, 2  (no mouse cursor)<br>
S3 Virge-based cards<br>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="software"></a><i><b>Do I need any special software to play Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>The Toontown installer will automatically make sure your computer has:</p>
<ul><li>Internet Explorer browser (version 4.0 or newer)</li>
<li>Microsoft's DirectX version 7.0 (or newer -- download the latest version from <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/directx>www.microsoft.com/directx</a>)</li>
<li>Macromedia's Flash Player, version 5.0 (or newer -- download the latest version from <a href=http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash>www.macromedia.com</a>)</li></ul></p>

<p><a name="speed"></a><i><b>How fast an Internet connection do I need to play Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>The faster the better, but Toontown is designed to work over even a 56K modem.</p>

<p><a name="adv"></a><i><b>Will someone with a faster Internet connection have an advantage playing?</b></i></p>
<p>No.  Toontown has been designed to work online so that everyone can
play together and compete with each other in the game.  The primary
benefit of a fast connection is that you won't have to wait as long
for the initial download.</p>

<p><a name="long"></a><i><b>How long does it take to download Toontown, and will I have to download it more than once?</b></i></p>
<p>Normal installation should take 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the speed of your Internet connection.  Occassionally there will be updates to Toontown that will have to be downloaded as well. These updates should download fairly quickly.</p>

<p><a name="nt"></a><i><b>Can Toontown run under Windows XP or Windows 2000?</b></i></p>
<p>Toontown works with Windows 98, ME, NT 4.0, 2000, and XP.  On NT/2000/XP,
you must install Toontown from an account with administrator privileges, but
administrator privileges should not be required to run Toontown unless
downloading an updated Toontown Launcher ActiveX control is required, and
in that case the user will be notified.  Other than that, a WinXP account
with <I>Limited User</I> privileges should be able to run Toontown
successfully.  Toontown will run on NT 4.0 if your video driver supports OpenGL acceleration.</p>

<p><a name="other_sys"></a><i><b>Can I play Toontown in operating systems other than Windows?</b></i></p>
<p>Not at this time, but we are open to requests.</p>

<p><a name="xp_limiteduser"></A><I><B>I'm having problems running Toontown from a Windows XP account with <I>Limited User</I>
security privileges.  What can I do?</b></i></p>
<P> First try starting Toontown from an adminstrator account to verify it runs properly.   If so, then from the administrator account,
open a command window using <I>Start->Run</I> and typing "cmd".  In the window, type
<BR>
<I>cacls "C:\Program Files\Disney\Disney Online\Toontown" /T /E /G Everyone:C</I><BR>
Then switch back to the Limited User account and try running Toontown again.
</P>

<p><a name="screenres"></a><i><b>What's the best screen resolution and number of colors for Disney's Toontown Online?</b></i></p>
<p>When Disney's Toontown Online is first installed, it will set itself to run at the best resolution and color settings for your computer. Once you're up and running, you can change these settings in-game on the Options page in your Shticker Book.</p>

<p><a name="harddrive"></a><i><b>What kind of information does Toontown put onto my computer's hard drive?</b></i></p>
<p>Toontown installs some game software onto your hard drive that is required for playing.  This is why you need at least 100 megabytes of space available on your system.  This process is just like any game installation and should not affect your computer in any other way, other than to allow you to play.</p>

<p><a name="uninstall"></a><i><b>How do I uninstall Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>Go to <i>Start Menu->Settings->Control Panel->Add/Remove Programs</i>.  Find <I>Disney's Toontown Online</I> and click <I>Remove</I> to perform the uninstall.</p>

<p><a name="gameupdate"></a><i><b>What is a "game update," and will I notice when they occur?</b></i></p>
<p>Like our theme parks, Disney's Toontown Online is constantly maintained and periodically updated with new features and attractions. These game updates will be downloaded and installed automatically upon entering the game.</p>

<p><a name="serverdown"></a><i><b>What does it mean if I see the message "Server Down" when I try to get to Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>Sometimes the unavoidable happens —- power goes out, a storm knocks out phone lines, or a game server has problems and has to be turned off and on again.  Also, there are times when the game servers must be pulled offline for maintenance.  In general, advance warning of maintenance will be given to all visitors, but if you see the “Server Down” message, don’t panic.  Just try Toontown again a short time later. Whenever possible, the same warning message will give you specific information on when to check back.</p>

<p><a name="communicate"></a><i><b>How can I communicate with other players in Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>For those that have not enabled the Secret Friends feature, Disney's Toontown Online has its own alternative method of communicating with other players. SpeedChat is a system that lets you choose from a list of words and phrases and assemble them together into sentences.</p>

<p><a name="aol"></a><i><b>Can I run Disney's Toontown Online from AOL?</b></i></p>
<p>Yes, but AOL child accounts will not let an Internet connection be
established outside of the AOL window.  AOL child accounts must have
parental control disabled to play Toontown.</p>

<p><a name="lowmemory"></a><i><b>I tried to install Toontown and it says I do not have enough memory, but I have 5 Gigabytes!</b></i></p>
<p>The error refers to RAM memory, not disk space.  You probably have only 32 or 64MB of RAM, which is not enough to play Toontown. Toontown requires a minimum of 128MB RAM in your system.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="gfxprobs"></a> What if I experience graphics problems with Toontown? </b></i></p>
<p>
First check that your graphics card is not on the list of <a HREF="#badcards">unsupported cards</A>.
Otherwise, there may be a problem with your video card driver.  Make sure you install the latest one
available on your manufacturer's website.  Also install the latest DirectX version from
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">http://www.microsoft.com/directx</A>.
<U>Windows 2000/XP users, please install the latest MS Service Pack for your OS</U> (available <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com">here</a>).
<BR>
<BR>
If your toontown mouse cursor is missing/drawn improperly, you can try switching to the regular windows cursor.  Run command.com (on win9x/ME) or cmd.exe (on winXP). Type <br><li>
<I>cd "C:\Program Files\Disney\Disney Online\Toontown"</I></li>
<li><I>Configrc.exe -cursor_off -save</I></li><br>
Then try starting Toontown as normal.
<BR><BR>
Another thing to try for graphics issues is switching Toontown's default graphics API.  Sometimes video drivers
support one API better than another. This can be done by running <br>
<I>Configrc.exe [XXX] -save</I> where [XXX] is <i>-OGL</I>, <i>-DX8</I>, or <i>-DX7</I>.<BR><br>

If all the above fails, please submit a problem report, and in addition
to attaching the log files please do the following:
<OL>
<li>Press the F9 key in the game to automatically save a screenshot image in a file
named "[frame_number].jpg" which will be saved in "C:\Program Files\Disney\Disney Online\Toontown"</li>
<li>Exit Toontown, go to the <i>Start Menu</I>, select <i>Run</I>, and type <i>dxdiag.exe</i></li>
<li>Click the <I>Save All Information</I> button, which saves the file DxDiag.txt, and then exit</li>
<li>Attach the files "DxDiag.txt" and "[frame_number].jpg" to the bug report, along with a description of the problem, and e-mail to toontown@disneyonline.com  You could also use the <a href="reportBug.php">Report Bug</a> page to do this.</li></OL>
<p/>

<p><i><b><a name="highres"></a>I tried switching Toontown to a high screen resolution and the game crashed, now it refuses to start.  What do I do?</b></i></p>
<p> Run command.com (on win9x/ME) or cmd.exe (on winXP). Type <br>
<li><I>cd "C:\Program Files\Disney\Disney Online\Toontown"</I></li>
<li><I>Configrc.exe -lowres -save</I></li><br>
When you next start Toontown, it should start at a resolution of 640x480.

<p><h4>Game Answers</p></h4>

<p><i><b><a name="playonown"></a> Can I play Toontown on my own, or should I join up with others?</b></i>
<p>Toontown is a multiplayer game -- there is no single-player version. You can, however, wander the streets, play Trolley Games, and play in Toontown as a Toon on your own. But it's more fun if you share the adventure. </p>

<p><i><b><a name="howmany"></a> How many people can play Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>Toontown is designed as a massively multiplayer game. There's enough room here for you and all your friends.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="getaround"></a> Is there some way to get around Toontown other than walking?</b></i></p>
<p>You can ride the Trolley to go play mini-games. Once you've visited the playground in any Toontown neighborhood, that neighborhood is added to the map in your Shticker Book. You can teleport back to the nearest playground at almost any time by clicking on the "Back to Playground" button below the map. After completing some ToonTasks, you will be able to teleport to other playgrounds by clicking on their pictures on the map. Finally, you can teleport to any of your friends in the game by clicking on their names -- onscreen or in your Friends List -- and then clicking on "Go To."</p>

<p><i><b><a name="manual"></a> Is there a manual or guide for Disney's Toontown Online?</b></i></p>
<p>Toontown starts with some help on how to play, so you don't really need a manual or guide. The "Toontorial" is available each time you create a new character. If enough players request it, a manual may be created.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="cheat"></a> What will happen to someone who tries to cheat or who doesn't follow the rules?</b></i></p>
<p>When you sign in to Toontown the first time you play, you will see options for "I Accept" or "I Do Not Accept."  By clicking on "I Accept" you agree to abide by Toontown's rules.  This means no cheating and no bothering other players.  Toontown guests who do not follow these rules and guidelines may be asked to leave Toontown, and may even be banned from ever returning.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#gamequest">Back to Game Questions</a></p>

<p><h4>Toon Answers</p></h4>
<p><i><b><a name="create"></a>How do I create my Toon?</b></i></p>
<p>When you start into Toontown, the first step will be to create your Toon -- it's easy and fun, so just follow directions from your hosts, Mickey and Minnie Mouse.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="nametoon"></a>Can I name my Toon anything?</b></i></p>
<p>After creating your Toon, you have the option of either picking a name with help from the name generator, or creating your own name -— which will be submitted for approval by the Toon Council.  Toon names are limited to a maximum number of characters, and also to three words. We should make it clear that Toon names cannot be obscene or offensive. Duplicate names are possible within Toontown.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="howmanytoons"></a>How many Toons can I have?</b></i></p>
<p>Each Toontown account can have six Toons at any one time.  You can delete one of these six, if you would like to create another.  But once you delete a Toon, everything associated with that Toon -- friends, clothes, gags, and everything -- will be erased.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="clothes"></a>Can I get special clothes for my Toon?</b></i></p>
<p>You can dress your Toon lots of different ways when you create your Toon. After completing certain ToonTasks, you may be rewarded with a clothing ticket which you can use at Clothing Stores in each playground if you decide to change your outfit.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="givetoon"></a>Can I give my Toon to someone else?</b></i></p>
<p>No. Your Toon is yours and cannot be traded.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="bothonline"></a>If I have more than one Toon, can they both be active in Toontown at the same time?</b></i></p>
<p>No.  Only one person on each Toontown account can be logged into Toontown at any time, and you can only have one Toon at a time active in Toontown.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="controltoon"></a>How do I control my Toon? With a keyboard, mouse, joystick, or a combination?</b></i></p>
<p>Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move your Toon around Toontown, and use the mouse to click on screen options or menu choices. You don't need a joystick to play.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="view"></a>How do I change my viewpoint?</b></i></p>
<p>The Tab key on your keyboard will let you switch your camera view of Toontown.  You can also use the 'page up' and 'page down' keys to look up and down.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="tooninfo"></a>How do I get information about my own Toon?</b></i></p>
<p>In the lower left corner of the screen, you'll see a "Laffmeter" that shows you how healthy your sense of humor is.  Also, the "Shticker Book," which appears in the lower right corner of the screen, has information about your accomplishments in the game, and what kind of Gags you have earned to fight the Cogs. You can click on the corners of the Shticker Book to flip through the pages.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="othertooninfo"></a>How do I get information about another Toon?</b></i></p>
<p>You can click on a Toon's name to learn more about that Toon.  By clicking on that Toon's name, you also have the option to add that Toon to your Friends List.  Once someone is on your Friends List, you can teleport to that person, or call that friend for help in a battle.  It's easy to change your Friends List--you always have the option to add or remove another Toon.  You can also talk to other Toons -- via SpeedChat -- to find out what their ToonTasks are.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="namesappear"></a>What are those names that appear on the screen -- are they other players?</b></i></p>
<p>Names with arrows appear onscreen indicating other Toons or buildings that are nearby, but not within view.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="otherstars"></a>Why do some Toons have stars over their names?  Can I have one too?</b></i></p>

<p>Stars are awarded to Toons who are especially proficient at rescuing buildings from the Cogs.  When you have helped to rescue at least five Cog buildings, and for as long as those buildings continue to remain safe from the Cogs, you will be awarded a bronze star.  You'll earn a silver star for rescuing even more buildings, and it's a rare Toon indeed who can rescue enough buildings to earn a gold star.</p>

<p>But you have to stay vigilant!  If the Cogs capture back enough of the buildings you rescued, you'll lose your star!  If this happens, you'll have to go out and rescue some more buildings to get your star back.</p>

<p>Note that all the buildings you rescue must be on the same district in order to count towards your star.  (See the "Districts" page in your <a href="#book">Shticker Book</a>.)  Stars are specific to the Toontown district you play on.  If you switch to another district, you will leave your star behind.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="mystardisappeared"></a>I had a star over my name, but now it's gone!  What happened?</b></i></p>

<p>There are two ways you can lose your star:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maybe the Cogs took back one or more of the buildings you had helped to rescue, dropping your total number of buildings rescued below five.  This can even happen while you are not logged on, since those villainous Cogs never sleep.  The only thing you can do is stay vigilant, and keep rescuing buildings!</li>
  <li>Maybe you recently switched to another district.  There are multiple districts within Toontown (see the "Districts" page in your <a href="#book">Shticker Book</a>), and each district is facing its own onslaught of Cogs.  You might have switched districts by picking another district from your Shticker Book, or by going to visit a friend who was in another district.  But the star you earned is specific to the district in which you rescued the buildings.  If you switch to another district, your star goes away; but you'll get your star back when you return (unless the Cogs took back several of your buildings while you were gone).</li>
</ul>

<p><i><b><a name="savegame"></a>How do I save my game?</b></i></p>
<p>Everything about your Toon -- looks, things you have collected, points earned, gags bought, Cogs defeated -- is automatically saved, so there's no need for you to do anything.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="exitgame"></a>How do I exit Toontown, and will my Toon still be there when I come back?</b></i></p>
<p>At the lower right corner of the screen, you'll see your "Shticker Book."  Turn to the first page, which is called "Options," and from there hitting "Exit Toontown" will take you back to your "Pick-a-Toon" stable of characters, where you can Quit completely or log out. Don't worry though, when you come back, your Toon or Toons will be waiting for you.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#toonquest">Back to Toon Questions</a></p>

<p><h4>Interface Answers</p></h4>
<p><i><b><a name="laffmeter"></a>What's a Laffmeter?</b></i></p>
<p>The Laffmeter appears on the lower left corner of the screen and shows you how healthy your sense of humor is.  The Laffmeter will go down if you are hit by Cogs during a battle.  Other Toons can help you regain your full sense of humor during battle by amusing you with one of the gags from their Toon-Up Track. Your Laffmeter will also gradually go up while you are in any playground or playing Trolley Games. Outside of battle, the fastest way to heal is by returning to the playground and collecting treasures.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="book"></a>What's a Shticker Book, and what's inside it?</b></i></p>
<p>The Shticker Book appears on the lower right corner of your screen. This is your main guide, and it includes the following:
<ul>
<li>Options - enables you to set game controls and exit</li>
<li>Districts - lists the active Toontown Districts and the population
for the district you are in</li>
<li>Toontown Map - shows the areas of Toontown you've seen and allows
you to go back to the last playground you were in.</li>
<li>Gags -  shows the Toon Gags you've received in trade for Jelly Beans</li>
<li>ToonTasks - shows your progress at completing Quests assigned by citizens of Toontown.</li>
<li>Gag Track Training - Shows your Toon's progression as you train to use new skills and more advanced gags.</li>
<li>Cog Gallery - keeps a tally of each Cog you've defeated.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><i><b><a name="speedchat"></a>How do I use SpeedChat?</b></i></p>
<p>SpeedChat is a point-and-click chat system that allows players to communicate safely by selecting phrases from preset lists. This system is dynamic, adapting to each Toon's specific ToonTasks, and allows for personal expression, questions, answers, and game advice. You access SpeedChat from the button in the upper left corner of your screen.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="friendslist"></a>How do I use the Friends List?</b></i></p>
<p>The Friends List appears in the upper right corner of the screen.  Click on it to see a list of your friends.  You can click on a Toon's name for information about that Toon or to add that person to your Friends List.  Once someone is on your Friends List, you can teleport to that person, or call that friend to help you out in a battle. You can easily add or remove Toons from your Friends List.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="secrets"></a>How do I chat freely with my real-life friends?  What is the Secret Friends Feature?</b></i></p>

<p>In order to use the Secret Friends feature, it must first be enabled by the Account Holder 
using the Parental Controls.</p>

<p>At the top of your friends list, there's a button labeled "Secrets." Once the Secret Friends feature is enabled you can click on this button to open a panel that will offer you the chance either to get a new Secret, or to type in a Secret from someone else.</p>

<p>A Secret is a temporary computer genereated code word that is assigned to you and to you alone.  Each time you get a Secret, a new random code will be assigned to you.  Tell this Secret to your real-life friend, and when your friend logs into Toontown and enters the Secret, the two of you will be marked as "secret friends", and you will be able to chat freely with each other using the keyboard.</p>

<p>Each Secret can only be entered by one real-life friend, and then it goes away.  If you want to become secret friends with multiple people, you should get several Secrets, one for each friend.</p>

<p>Your friend only has 48 hours to enter your Secret.  If he or she doesn't enter it in that time, it goes away, and you will have to get another one.  But once you become secret friends, you'll stay that way forever until one of you decides to break the friendship or the Secret Friends feature is disabled by the Account Holder.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot offer the Secret Friends feature during your free/trial period. It is available only to "official members" of Disney's Toontown Online. For paying members, this feature is initially turned off-but can be enabled, accessed and controlled via the Parent Password and the "Account Options" page. To learn more about how to enable Secret Friends, please <a href="secretFriends.php">click here</a>.</p>

<p><h4>Mini-Game and Gag Answers</p></h4>
<p><i><b><a name="trolleydo"></a>What does the Trolley do in Toontown, and why would I want to ride it?</b></i></p>
<p>In the playground of each Toontown Neighborhood there is a Trolley Station. The Trolley takes you to the Trolley Games, fun games of skill and chance.  You can play to win Jelly Beans that you can trade for Gags to use against the Cogs.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="gags"></a>What are Gags, how do I get them, and what do I do with them?</b></i></p>
<p>Gags are bits of physical humor that you can use to "lighten up" the Cogs and make them disappear.  There are seven "Gag Tracks" to master, and each track has six different levels of Gags.  As you advance in the game, you get access to more tracks and types of Gags to earn and use.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="stealgags"></a>Can any other Toon steal my Gags?</b></i></p>
<p>No, your stuff is yours.  You can only lose your stuff if you lose all your points in a battle with a Cog and get sent back to a safe playground.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="tradegags"></a>Can I trade Gags with other Toons?</b></i></p>
<p>No, your stuff is yours. You cannot trade gags.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="emptytoontask"></a>My ToonTask listing contains an empty entry.  How can I fill it?</b></i></p>
<p>Visit any shop owner or a neighborhood Headquarters and one of the citizens of Toontown should be able to find something for you to do.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="whatsabugle"></a>My ToonTask was 'Deliver 2 Bugles to Fifi'.  What is a Bugle and how do I get it?</b></i></p>
<p>A Bugle is a brass wind instrument somewhat shorter than a trumpet and lacking keys or valves. It is one of the sound Gags and you probably don't have access to it yet, so you should work on improving your sound skills so you can acquire one! If you don't recognize an item you are asked to deliver, it is either a Gag you need to improve your skills to be able to use or a special item that will be delivered to you as a reward for either defeating a special cog, or completing another ToonTask.</P>

<p><i><b><a name="fruitpietask"></a>My ToonTask was 'Deliver 2 Fruit Pies to Flippy'.  I walked up to the counter and Flippy said 'Keep up the good work!', but didn't reward me!</b></i></p>
<p>You probably tried to deliver 2 Fruit Pie Slices to Flippy, not 2 Fruit Pies, which are a separate higher-level Gag. Similarly, Cream Pie Slices are a different Gag than Cream Pies. There are pictures associated with each ToonTask on your page which should help you complete your mission.</P>

<p align="right"><a href="#minigagquest">Back to Mini-Game and Gag Questions</a></p>

<p><h4>Cog Answers</p></h4>
<p><i><b><a name="cogs"></a>What are Cogs, and what are they doing here?</b></i></p>
<p>Cogs are part of an invention that has gone terribly wrong. They are turning Toontown into a black-and-white metropolis of skyscrapers and businesses -- it is up to every Toon to find a way to battle them and ultimately stop them.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="diffcogs"></a>How many different Cogs are there, and do different Gags work differently on them?</b></i></p>
<p>There are lots of different Cogs, but the main point is not that different Gags work differently on them, but that there are unique combinations of Gags that are more effective.  For example, if you use a "Trap" Gag, such as a banana peel, you'll want to use a "Lure" Gag such as money to get the Cog to step forward and slip on the peel. Rolling your mouse over the various gags in your inventory will help you understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of each of them.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="battleprimer"></a>How does 'Battle' work?</b></i></p>
<p>Robot Cogs are thwarted by your using Gags on them.  You can fight Cogs alone, or with a group of Toons. Once in battle you can:</p>
<ul><li>Attack -- use a Gag on the Cog</li>
<li>Heal -- use a healing Gag on another Toon in the battle.</li>
<li>Call for help -- ask friends to help you in battle by sending them an 'SOS'</li>
<li>Run -- if you think you are in over your head during a street battle, you can run back to the nearest Playground</li></ul></p>

<p><i><b><a name="cogtypes"></a>What is a 'Sellbot', 'Cashbot', etc?</b></i></p>
<p>Sellbots are cogs that are experts in the art of marketing.  The 'Telemarkter' is one example of a Sellbot. Cashbots are primarily concerned with monetary issues.  Every Cog has their type displayed over their head with their name. If you aren't sure what type of Cog you are dealing with, you can click on one of them in streets and a detail panel will give you more information about which Cog "family" they belong to.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="battle"></a>How do I keep the Cogs from taking over Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>Robot Cogs are thwarted by your using Gags on them.  You can fight Cogs alone, or with a group of Toons. Once in battle you can:</p>
<ul><li>Attack - use a Gag on the Cog.</li>
<li>Toon-up - use a Gag to refill another Toon's Laffmeter in the battle.</li>
<li>Call for help - ask friends to help in battle by sending them an "SOS.</li>
<li>Run - teleport back to the playground.</li></ul></p>

<p><i><b><a name="cogbuilding"></a>How can I tell what kind of Cogs work in a Cog building?</b></i></p>
<p>Cog buildings are plainly labeled with signs above the door. You can also hang around the building awhile and notice the Cogs that go in and out. Also, notice that not all Cog buildings look alike.</P>

<p><i><b><a name="gagcombo"></a>Does the gag I use affect other toon's gag attacks?</b></i></p>
<p>There are unique combinations of Gags that are more effective.  For example, if you use a Trap Gag, such as a banana peel, you'll want to use a Lure Gag such as money to get the Cog to step forward and slip on the peel.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="secretbattle"></a>Are there secret battle sequences that will earn me extra points?</b></i></p>
<p>If multiple Toons select the same Gag, the combination makes for a more powerful attack. Similarly, luring Cogs closer before springing a Gag on them will result in a more powerful attack.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="lose"></a>What happens if I lose a battle?</b></i></p>
<p>If your Laffmeter hits zero, your Toon is sent to the nearest playground for recovery. You will also lose all the Gags you were carrying. After you lose a battle, hang around the playground until you heal and play Trolley Games to restock your Gag inventory.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="die"></a>Can my Toon ever die?</b></i></p>
<p>No.  Toons never die. They just lose their sense of humor for a little while.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="heal"></a>How do I "heal" my Toon or refill my Laffmeter?</b></i></p>

<p>Another Toon can use a Toon-up Gag on you when in battle.  You recover quickest by collecting special treasures in the playgrounds, like the starfish in Donald's Dock.  Finally, your Laffmeter will slowly fill back up all by itself whenever you spend time in a playground or playing Trolley Games.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#cogquest">Back to Cog Questions</a></p>

<p><h4>Talking to other Toons</p></h4>
<p><i><b><a name="speedchat2"></a>How do I talk with other players-what's Speed Chat?</b></i></p>
<p>SpeedChat is a point-and-click chat system that lets you talk with other Toons by selecting canned phrases from a preset menu.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="secrets2"></a>What are "Secrets?"</b></i></p>
<p>Secret passwords are used in the Secret Friends feature of the game and enable you to chat freely with another Toon. You can set this up with your "real- life" friend so you can talk online. A Secret Password is requested from the Friends/Secret panel in the upper right corner of the screen. This password must be communicated outside of the game (to ensure safety). Once the password has been generated in-game and delivered to friend A, it must be entered in-game by friend B within 48 hours or the password will expire. Each password is unique and can be used with only 1 friend. To openly chat with 2 or more friends, a secret password must be created for each friend.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="hearsomething"></a>What's happening when other Toons "talk" and what I see/hear is something that doesn't make sense?</b></i></p>
<p>The other players are chatting using the keyboard (instead of SpeedChat), but since the Secret Friends feature is not enabled between you, all you will hear/see is "meow, meow, meow" or "bark, bark, ruff" (depending on the species).</p>

<p>If you think the other player is trying to talk to you, there are selections in SpeedChat that let you suggest they use that (SpeedChat) to communicate with you.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="filter"></a>Is there a bad word filter in Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>Yes. Obscenities are filtered from chat messages in Toontown.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="whisper"></a>Can I talk to just one Toon?</b></i></p>
<p>Yes. After clicking on the name (on-screen or in your Friends list) of the Toon you'd like to message, select "Whisper." A special pop-up window will appear with the chat buttons. Use the appropriate button (depending on account permissions) to send a "Whisper."  These messages are sent directly to that Toon, and are not broadcast to others nearby.</p>

<p><i><b><a name="meetup"></a>How do I meet up with a friend somewhere in Toontown?</b></i></p>
<p>Your Friends List tells you which of your friends are online or offline-it keeps you informed about who is currently playing and who isn't. Click on that person's name and choose "Go To" to be sent to their location. You will also get a notification bubbles on your screen whenever a friend logs on or off the game, or is teleporting to you.</p>

<p><h4>Managing your Account Options</p></h4> 
<p><i><b><a name="trialper"></a>What happens after my free trial period?</b></i></p>
<p>During your free trial period, you will be given the option to sign up for a membership to Disney's Toontown Online. If you choose not to join at that time, you can continue to play until your free trial expires. If you do not subscribe after your free trial, you will no longer have access to Toontown. Should you want to re-subscribe in the future, you will have to start the game from the beginning.</p> 

<p><i><b><a name="canceltri"></a>What if I want to cancel during my free trial period?</b></i></p>
<p>You can cancel at any time during your free trial period. Or you can let your free trial period lapse and not sign up for a monthly subscription. Since no credit card information is requested upon your free trial, you will not be billed.</p>
